# Code Examples from Slides

This folder contains code examples taken directly from the professor's slides, used in class to illustrate important concepts in the course. These examples serve as practice and help in understanding the implementation of topics such as pointers, recursive functions, and dynamic linked lists.

## Structure

- **`pointers.c`**: This file contains examples of pointer allocation, taken from the slides on the use of pointers in C.
- **`recursive_algorithms.c`**: This file includes examples of recursive algorithms, such as factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and recursive array operations. It also demonstrates indirect recursion and tail recursion.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide a practical reference for the theoretical concepts discussed in class, helping reinforce the material.

## Notes

These examples may be simple, but they are crucial for understanding the fundamentals of C programming and general programming concepts.
